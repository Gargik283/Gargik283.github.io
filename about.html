    <main>
        <p>Hello, I'm GARGI KUNDU, a recent graduate with a BTech in Electronics and Communication(VLSI DESIGN) from MCKV Institute of  Engineering. I'm passionate about VLSI design and eager to begin my career in this exciting field.</p>
        <p>During my studies, I gained a solid foundation in analog design, digital design, CMOS circuits, Verilog/VHDL. I completed academic training from MICROELECTRONICS AND VLSI DESIGN From Jadavpur University .</p>
        <p>My academic projects included 'SMART BLIND STICK USING ARDUINO UNO'.The importance of this project is to help the blind person, to alert them from any obstacles nearby within a certain range. I have used java as the programming language for writing code in ARDUNIO IDE software. The components used for making this projects are arduino,buzzer,ultrasonic sensor,breadboard,jumpers and wires. I'm proficient in using tools such as EDA,FPGA,VERILOG,Xilinx.</p>
        <p>I'm a quick learner and enthusiastic about contributing to innovative VLSI projects. I'm actively seeking opportunities to apply my knowledge and develop my skills.</p>
